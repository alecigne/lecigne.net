#+title: Projects

A list of personal projects. Some projects have been integrated to
this website, others are simple links to external resources (GitHub,
etc.).

* Code

** Java

:END:

- [[https://github.com/alecigne/somafm-recentlib][somafm-recentlib]] ::  A Java library that retrieves recently played
  tracks from [[https://somafm.com/][SomaFM]].

- [[https://github.com/alecigne/deezer-datasync][deezer-datasync]] :: Java application that backups data from
  Deezer. In its current state, it calls Deezer (their API still
  works), and makes a commit in a private repository. A GitHub repo as
  persistence can feel weird, but it's very practical since I can
  check the diff easily and I have nothing to self-host.
