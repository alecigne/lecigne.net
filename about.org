#+TITLE: About...

* ...me

- Anthony Le Cigne, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986][33]]
- Software engineer working mainly with Java
- PhD in cellular biology
- You will find me on [[https://github.com/alecigne/][Github]] and [[https://fr.linkedin.com/in/anthonylecigne][LinkedIn]]

* ...the website

The pages you see in this website were written with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]]. The publishing process is fully automatic:

- A selection of Org documents from my [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki][personal wiki]] (my [[https://github.com/alecigne/.emacs.d][Emacs
  configuration]], my [[https://github.com/alecigne/public-notes][notes]], etc.) are merged together into a
  "proto-website";
- All files in the "proto-website" are exported to HTML (and maybe
  other formats in the future, such as PDF);
- The files resulting from the export are uploaded on this website.

When I'm on the go, I use [[https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android][Orgzly]] to take notes in Org format. The
publishing process uses Emacs in batch mode thanks to [[https://termux.com/][Termux]].

The whys and hows of this setup will be addressed one day in a [[file:notes/notes.org][note]].
