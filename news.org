I've added a [[file:projects/projects.org][Projects]] section to the website! As written on the
[[file:index.org][homepage]], they are independant GitHub repositories that use the same
documentation format as this website ([[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]).

The first project is [[file:projects/fennel-sandbox/README.org][fennel-sandbox]] -- have a look üôÇ

A new [[file:notes/flipper-brute-force.org][note]] about... brute-forcing my garage door with a Flipper Zero üòÉ

This note is actually still a draft, but it was on a Git branch for so
long that I decided to include it. Hopefully, I'll make it evolve from
there.

I also updated the website's organization. In particular, there's now
a "[[file:themes/themes.org][themes]]" page with (manually-created) backlinks to notes.

The [[file:notes/compiling-emacs.org][Compiling Emacs]] note has been updated since the =--with-json= flag

Newsworthy? Probably not. But hey, it's an update!

Wow, some activity:

- A new [[file:notes/compiling-emacs.org][note]] about how I usually compile Emacs.

- Another [[file:notes/signal-export.org][note]] about exporting [[https://signal.org/][Signal]] backups to various formats.

Also, I disabled exports in PDF and TXT to simplify the exporting
process.

TXT (this is experimental and will be improved).
