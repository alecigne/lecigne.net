#+title: lecigne.net

This is the source for my [[https://lecigne.net/][website]].

[[https://github.com/casey/just][Just]] is used to execute predefined actions -- see [[file:Justfile][Justfile]].

- =just clean= will remove any files that are not part of the source
  itself (such as HTML files).

- =just publish= will publish the website (which means exporting it to
  HTML, in Org-mode lingo) using Emacs -- see [[file:publish.el][publish.el]].

- =just deploy= will transfer the updated HTML files to my webserver
  usin =rclone=.
