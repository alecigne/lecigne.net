#+TITLE: lecigne.net

This is the source for my [[https://lecigne.net/][website]].

These pages result from the HTML export of various subprojects written
using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] markup language. As of today, these
subprojects are:

- My [[https://github.com/alecigne/.emacs.d][Emacs configuration]]
- My [[https://github.com/alecigne/public-notes][public notes]]

The website structure is then synchronized to the webserver using the
[[https://rclone.org/][rclone]] [[https://rclone.org/sftp/][SFTP backend]]:

#+begin_src bash
  rclone -v sync --exclude "/.git/" ~/pub/website website:www/
