#+TITLE: lecigne.net

This is the source for my [[https://lecigne.net/][website]].

In this repo I keep *only* the files that are directly related to my
website, such as the index page, the about page or the CSS. The
website itself is generated from a combination of various subprojects
such as:

- These website-specific files
- My [[https://github.com/alecigne/.emacs.d][Emacs configuration]]
- My [[https://github.com/alecigne/public-notes][public notes]]

All these subprojects are written using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] markup
language. The website is generated[fn:1] automatically by Emacs itself
using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][the ~org-publish~ command]].

Although Emacs could take care of it, I prefer to synchronize the
website with the webserver using the [[https://rclone.org/][rclone]] [[https://rclone.org/sftp/][SFTP backend]]:

#+begin_src bash
  rclone -v sync --exclude "/.git/" ~/pub/website website:www/
#+end_src

[fn:1] Combination of subprojects + HTML export
