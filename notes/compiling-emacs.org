#+title: Compiling Emacs

A little personal reminder on how I usually compile Emacs... After
[[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git/][cloning]] and =cd='ing in the source directory:

#+begin_src sh
./autogen.sh
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
./configure --without-compress-install --with-native-compilation=aot --with-json --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter --with-gif --with-png --with-jpeg --with-rsvg --with-tiff --with-imagemagick
#+end_src

Some of these flags are a bit arbitrary, I should look into this.

#+begin_src sh
make -j $(nproc)
#+end_src

...and that's it! Of course many packages will probably miss, but I'll
add them on this page the next time I compile Emacs from a fresh
system.

I usually create a symbolic link in a directory on my path:

#+begin_src sh
ln -s ~/src/emacs/src/emacs emacs
#+end_src
