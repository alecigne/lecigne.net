#+title: Accessing a Synology NAS without a router

Recently, I had an issue with my home router, but I needed to access
some files on my Synology NAS. Below is a quick self-reminder of the
method I used to connect to the web interface. This should work for
any type of network device.

1. Plug the NAS into your computer via Ethernet.

2. Since the NAS lost its connection to the router, it will have
   assigned itself a fallback IP from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address][link-local]] range. Using
   [[https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan][=arp-scan=]], we will scan the entire IP range to find the NAS:

   #+begin_src sh
     sudo arp-scan --interface=[your-interface] 169.254.0.0/16
   #+end_src

   For example, the IP might be: =169.254.239.105=.

3. Once you have the IP, set your PC's IP on the same interface to be
   in the same range, for example =169.254.239.50=:

   #+begin_src sh
     sudo ip addr add 169.254.239.50/16 dev [your-interface]
   #+end_src

4. You should now be able to access the Synology web interface on
   =169.254.239.105:5000= ðŸ™‚
