#+title: Setting up NetworkManager on a minimal Linux install

#+options: num:nil

I really like [[https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/nmcli.html][=nmcli=]] (from [[https://networkmanager.dev/][NetworkManager]]). It is a minimalist CLI
tool for managing network connections. It is ideal for servers,
terminals, and automation.

However, I encountered a few problems that deserve a little note.

** Unmanaged interface

When installing Debian, the installer might ask you for a WiFi
password. This will update the =/etc/network/interfaces= file:

#+begin_src conf
  # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
  # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

  source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

  # The loopback network interface
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

  # The primary network interface
  allow-hotplug wifi0
  iface wifi0 inet dhcp
          wpa-ssid MySSID
          wpa-psk  a-secure-passphrase
#+end_src

However, as stated [[https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager#Wired_Networks_are_Unmanaged][here]], this can interfere with NetworkManager since
this tool won't manage any interface defined in the aforementioned
file when =/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf= contains:

#+begin_src conf
  [main]
  plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

  [ifupdown]
  managed=false
#+end_src

...which in my experience is usually the case.

When running:

#+begin_src bash
  nmcli device status
#+end_src

...you might see something like:

#+begin_example
  DEVICE             TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION
  wifi0              wifi      unmanaged               --
#+end_example

In addition, you probably won't see any networks when running =nmcli
device wifi list=.

** MAC address randomization

=NetworkManager= also use MAC randomization by default, which has
caused me some problems in the past.

* The solution

1. Delete everything related to the interface from
   =/etc/network/interfaces=. The file above would become:

   #+begin_src conf
     # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
     # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

     source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

     # The loopback network interface
     auto lo
     iface lo inet loopback
   #+end_src

2. Set =ifupdown.managed= to =true= in
   =/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf=:

   #+begin_src conf
     [main]
     plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

     [ifupdown]
     managed=true
   #+end_src

3. Create =/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi_rand_mac.conf= with the
   following content:

   #+begin_src conf
     [device-mac-randomization]
     wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=yes

     [connection-mac-randomization]
     ethernet.cloned-mac-address=permanent
     wifi.cloned-mac-address=permanent
   #+end_src

4. Reboot ðŸ™‚ Maybe restarting NetworkManager is enough:

   #+begin_src bash
     sudo service NetworkManager restart
   #+end_src
