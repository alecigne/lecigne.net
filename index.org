Welcome to my (rather minimalistic) website. You're browsing
[[https://github.com/alecigne/lecigne.net/tree/v2025-01-18][v2025-01-18]].

Since it was "under construction" for years, I decided to simply use
it for [[file:notes/notes.org][public notes]] and let it evolve organically from there, in both
form and content.

There is no comment section, but if you feel like dropping a word, you
can use the [[https://github.com/alecigne/lecigne.net/discussions][Discussions section]] of the corresponding [[https://github.com/alecigne/lecigne.net][GitHub repo]].

- [[file:news.org][News]]: just a (manual) feed about what I consider to be significant
  updates (on my website's scale :D)

- [[file:notes/notes.org][Notes]]: just because "articles" was a bit too pompous, but that's
  what they are -- reference documents that can evolve with time.

- [[file:projects/projects.org][Projects]]: projects, or "microsites" as I call them, are independant
  GitHub repositories that use the same documentation format as this
  website ([[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]). They're "injected" into this website during the
  publishing process which, of course, is taken care of by the One
  True Editor -- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

- [[file:themes/themes.org][Themes]]: a few pages describing my main centers of interest, with
  backlinks that refer to notes

- [[file:about.org][About]]: the "meta" section -- a few words about the website and
  myself, because hey, why not.

- +Blog+: one day there will be a blog section!
