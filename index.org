#+TITLE: Anthony Le Cigne's public notes

Welcome to my (not at all minimalist) website.

Since it was "under construction" for years, I decided to simply use
it for public notes and let it evolve from there.

* Notes

- [[file:notes/git-fu.html][Git-Fu]]
- [[file:notes/gnupg.html][GnuPG]]
- [[file:notes/stow.html][GNU Stow]]
- [[file:notes/common-lisp.html][Setting up a Common Lisp environment]]
- [[file:notes/emacs/README.html][SwanEmacs]], my Emacs configuration \\
  This is an example of Org mode's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] abilities. The
  Org files can be exported to executable Emacs Lisp files and to many
  other formats, including the HTML you're reading now. The Org source
  is also [[https://github.com/alecigne/.emacs.d][on Github]].
